What is Stellar:

Stellar is an application that helps students manage their classes in a more efficient way. 

1)Students shall be able to search and register for the classes they need (CRNs, class title, and description). 
2)Because of the rapid rate in which classes fill and classes being added into the system at different times, students shall also have an alert system to send a notification when a class has been opened or warn them when a class is almost at max capacity (when theyâ€™re about 5 seats left). 

The software shall also provide feedback to the students on their academic progression, displaying their GPA (4.0 scale), current classes, previous classes taken and prerequisite each class.
